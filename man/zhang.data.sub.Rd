\description{
The data contains 498 neuroblastoma tumors. In short, unstranded
poly(A)+ RNA sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina).
Paired-end reads with a length of 100 nucleotides were obtained. To quantify
the full transcriptome, raw fastq files were processed with Kallisto v0.42.4
(index build with GRCh38-Ensembl v85). The pseudo-alignment tool Kallisto
was chosen above other quantification methods as it is performing equally
good but faster. For this study, a subset of 172 tumors (samples) with
high-risk disease were selected, forming two groups: the MYCN amplified
($n_1$ = 91) and MYCN non-amplified ($n_2$ = 81) tumours. Sometimes we refer
this dataset to as the Zhang data or the Zhang neuroblastoma data. In this
package, a subset of 5000 genes (randomly selected) are made available for illustration
purpose only.
