\title{Configure experiment}
\usage{
configExperiment(batch.config, group.config, tot.samples, batch, group)
}
\arguments{
\item{batch.config}{a numerical vector for the marginal fraction of samples in each batch.
The number of batches to be simulated is equal to the size of the vector.
All values must sum to 1.}

\item{group.config}{a numerical vector for the marginal fraction of samples in each group.
The number of groups to be simulated is equal to the size of the vector. All values must sum to 1.}

\item{tot.samples}{total number of samples to be simulated.}

\item{batch, group}{batch and grouping vectors}
}
\value{
a list object contating the number of groups and batches to be simukated,
and the experiment configurartion
}
